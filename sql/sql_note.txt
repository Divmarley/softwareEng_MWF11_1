SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.
These SQL commands are mainly categorized into four categories as:
    1.DDL - Data Definition Language.
    2.DQl – Data Query Language.
    3.DML – Data Manipulation Language.
    4.DCL – Data Control Language.


Query

SElECT c FROM men;

SELECT * FROM table_name;


select students whose balances is not equal to 0



SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;


The SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.

The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:

The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

AND Syntax





The SQL ORDER BY Keyword
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

ORDER BY Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;



CREATE TABLE  post(
    id INT(255),
    title VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT(10000)
);

INSERT INTO `post` (`id`,`title`,`description`) VALUES ('2','games','play is paid');
